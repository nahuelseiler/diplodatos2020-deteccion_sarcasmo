    "Se puede ver que las palabras que aparecían con mayor frecuencia eran aquellas que tenían entre 1 y 2 caracteres o sino signos especiales, las mismas no aportaban una importancia significativa a nuestro análisis y por eso consideramos que deberían ser filtradas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Se puede ver que en los gráficos ateriores las frecuencias de apariciones de palabras comenzaban con aproximadamente 12000 y 14000 apariciones para el caso de sarcasmo y no sarcasmo respectivamente. Una vez que se realizó el filtrado de las mismas, las mayores frecuencias se redujeron a 4500 y 3500 aparecines respectivamente. El conjunto total de ocurrencias se redujo y con llo también el peso de las frecuencias de las palabras que permanecieron en el dataset."

    "En este punto se consideró qué tanto los signos de admiración como de exclamación son relevantes para el trabajo. Se hipotetizó que la gran cantidad de ocurrencias de estos tal vez sean indicativo de que  cuando se escribe de manera sarcástica en el idioma inglés se emplea característicamente el uso de dichos signos y es por ello que podrían marcar una diferencia entre comentarios sarcásticos de los que no. \n",
    "\n",
    "Se puede ver una frecuencia del signo de exclamación de 4585 para el caso del sarcasmo y 3545 para el caso del no sarcasmo, y para el signo de admiración 1692 y 526 apariciones respectivamente. Se puede ver una diferencia de casi mil apariciones más para el sarcasmo que para el no sarcasmo, lo que podría denotar alguna \"tendencia\" del uso de los signos para hablar de manera sarcástica. Sin embargo, una vez que tenemos los datos normalizados estos pesos se relativizan, por un lado. Además el número de ocurrencias sigue sin representar un porcentaje mayoritariod ocurrencias en toda la lista de sarcasmo (su peso oscila entre 0.01 y 0.02).\n",
    "\n",
    "Además tenemos conocimiento de que los algoritmos no toman en cuenta este tipo de signos en sus análisis por lo general. Podríamos decir que dependiendo el trasfondo teórico \"lingüístico\" con el que nos comprometamos, bien podríamos optar por un modelo para el cual los signos no son relevantes. \n",
    "En este práctico los tendremos en cuenta, y a medida que se realicen análisis más profundos se podrá decidir si son relevantes o es mejor filtrarlos."

Esto a su vez puede hacer que  información crítica quede relegada: después de todo cada ocurrencia es en sí misma el comentario sarcástico a analizar y este tipo de análisis no pareciera aportar nada en ese nival propiamente dicho."
